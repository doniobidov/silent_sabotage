## LIDAR Data Visualization

This image shows the robot's LIDAR scan. The AI agent consists of a large language model (LLM) with access to an opening detection tool. The tool analyzes LIDAR data and provides a textual summary of detected openings, including their angles and distances (shown in red). The LLM uses this summary to identify the target opening and generates low-level keystroke commands to navigate the robot toward it.
