## LIDAR Data Visualization

This image shows the robot's LIDAR scan. An opening detection tool analyzes the scan and provides a textual summary of detected openings â€” including their angles and distances (marked in red). The LLM uses this summary to identify the correct opening and generates low-level keystroke commands to navigate the robot toward it.
